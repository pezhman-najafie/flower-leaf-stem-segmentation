# flower-leaf-stem-segmentation
 This MATLAB code segments a flower image to detect flower and leaf-stem regions using binary thresholding, morphological operations, and boundary extraction. The code calculates the area and perimeter of the flower and leaf-stem regions, displays results, and marks coordinates of significant pixels.
